# myBroadbandSpeedtest

Phantom JS script to do a speedtest on myBroadband

This script is not very reliable but it works. Need to figure out a way to actually make JS wait properly.

Requirements
PhantomJS and CasperJS, also NPM (To install them)
```
npm install -g phantomjs casperjs
```

Usage.
```
casperjs speedtest.js
```
